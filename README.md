Intelligent Accident Hotspot Analytics

Road traffic accidents remain one of the leading causes of fatalities and serious injuries 
worldwide, posing a major challenge to public safety and urban infrastructure planning. 
The rapid growth of vehicular traffic and urbanization has resulted in a massive volume of 
accident-related data that cannot be efficiently processed using traditional data analysis 
techniques. CrashSense: Intelligent Accident Hotspot Analytics aims to leverage Big 
Data Analytics to analyze large-scale road accident datasets and identify accident-prone 
locations, commonly referred to as accident hotspots. 

To identify accident hotspots, spatial aggregation and density-based analysis techniques are 
applied to detect regions with high accident concentration. Furthermore, machine learning 
models are employed to predict accident severity and assess the risk level of specific 
locations based on historical patterns. These predictive insights enable proactive 
identification of high-risk zones, allowing authorities to take preventive measures rather 
than reactive responses. 
The results of the analysis are visualized through intuitive charts, heatmaps, and geographic 
maps that provide clear and actionable insights. By combining large-scale data processing, 
intelligent analytics, and effective visualization, CrashSense demonstrates how Big Data 
technologies can be used to enhance road safety planning and decision-making. The 
proposed system can assist traffic authorities, urban planners, and policymakers in 
optimizing resource allocation, improving road infrastructure, and ultimately reducing 
accident rates and fatalities.
