Intelligent Accident Hotspot Analytics

Road traffic accidents remain one of the leading causes of fatalities and serious injuries 
worldwide, posing a major challenge to public safety and urban infrastructure planning. 
The rapid growth of vehicular traffic and urbanization has resulted in a massive volume of 
accident-related data that cannot be efficiently processed using traditional data analysis 
techniques. CrashSense: Intelligent Accident Hotspot Analytics aims to leverage Big 
Data Analytics to analyze large-scale road accident datasets and identify accident-prone 
locations, commonly referred to as accident hotspots.
